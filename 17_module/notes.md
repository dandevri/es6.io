* Overwrite the default behavior for objects default operations. Methods with default objects.
* Setters and getters for example. You can also overwrite other properties.
* Takes a target and handler. Handler; operations to rewrite.
* Traps; overwrite defaut. Sits between the object.
* Each thing inside a handler is called a trap.
