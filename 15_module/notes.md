# Classes

## Prototypal inheritence review
* ES6 brought classes to JavaScript, not a new way to do Object Oriented Inheritance.
* Exact same prototypal inheritance; just new way to write them.

* Prototypal inheritance; put a method on the original constructor, it will be inherited.
* Prototype methods; for example create an array. Every instance will inherit.
* Methods can be specific of instance, but can be part of the prototype.
