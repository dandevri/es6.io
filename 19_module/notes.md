# Map and Weak Map

## Maps
* Sets are to arrays; maps are to objects.
* It's got a key in the value.
* You can loop over them with `forEach` or for of loop
* What's better then objects? You can use a for loop, but that also coming to objects.

## Map metadata with DOM Node keys
* You can use an object as the key in an object.
* Maps can be used as metadata; holds information about an object.
* Metadata not on the object but about the object

## WeakMap and Garbage Collection
* WeakMap doesn't have a size, you cannot loop over it.
* Weak is memory leak, weakmap garbage collection.
