# ES6.io

> Exercises from ES6 for Everyone.

## Introduction
This course contains my exercises, notes and code along while following the [ES6 for everyone](https://es6.io/) course from [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/).

## The Course

*A premium training course to strengthen your core JavaScript skills and master all that ES6 has to offer. ES6 is a major update to JavaScript that includes dozens of new features. With a focus on simplicity and readability, this course is an efficient way to find out what is new in JavaScript and most importantly when and how you should use it.*

## Take-away
A course is nice way to know features and new syntax, but to really get the hang of it you just have to code and use it daily. It's good to know features exist but for specific syntax you can always check it in the docs, you don't have to remember everything.

## The Why

> The completion of this Course is part of my [100daysofcode](https://github.com/dandevri/cod.es) challenge.

A couple of months ago I made a promise to myself; spend an hour every day learning new stuff. And yes, in the weekends I would watch a course or read some articles but the time devoted on 'learning' was really inconsistent.

By making this public I am trying to commit to this promise. The idea is to track my progress and keep a log of each day writing down the stuff I learned and the tasks I completed along the way.
