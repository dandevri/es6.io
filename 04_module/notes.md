# Additional String Improvements

## New string methods
* String with ES6 comes with four new methods; reduce reliance of regexp.
* You can use startsWith or endsWith to check certain strings for characters.
* startsWith; you can ignore the first digits
* endswith; you can only check within a certain range
* includes; anywhere in the string
* repeat; takes a string and repeat it a number of times
