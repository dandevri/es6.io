# Desctructuring

## Desctructuring Objects
* JS expressions to extract data from arrays and object into their own variables
* Give me variables and take them from the object
* Renaming your variables; you can rename them while destructuring
* Ability to set defaults; 
* While you are destructuring you can also set a default (placeholder) value.

## Destructuring Arrays
* Destructure while using index instead of objects
* When it's a string you can use split and destructuring
* If you destructure less items then there are in the array it will throw them out.
* Rest operator; it gives you the rest

## Swapping variables
* You can't really update values cause you lose them on updating
* You could use a temporary value
* When swapping with destructure you use let because you are updating them.

## Destructuring Functions
* You can sort of return multiple values from a function
* You can return an object and destructure the answer
* Default named arguments
* Wrap arguments in curly brackets, we pass in a object
